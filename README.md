## Overview

I have Created the backend server for my current City Explorer app.

## Getting Started

I need to create a new local server in which I can both store and retrieve data from. 

## Architecture

The design of this app is to have an input where you are able to input a specific location and this app would send an API call to retrieve the information about the city, that you looked for, you would get the weather and the lon and lat.
